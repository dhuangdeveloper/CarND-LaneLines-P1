Overview
---

When we drive, we use our eyes to decide where to go.  The lines on the road that show us where the lanes are act as our constant reference for where to steer the vehicle.  Naturally, one of the first things we would like to do in developing a self-driving car is to automatically detect lane lines using an algorithm.

This repository contains a code and report fo rfinding lane lines. 

The notebook with the code is P1.ipynb (https://github.com/dhuangdeveloper/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.ipynb).
The HTML version of the notebook is P1.html (https://github.com/dhuangdeveloper/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/P1.html).
The write-up is writeup_P1.md (https://github.com/dhuangdeveloper/CarND-LaneLines-P1/blob/master/writeup_P1.md)
The reports contains result for 3 set of videos:
